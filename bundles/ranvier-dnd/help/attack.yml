command: attack
body: |
    Use a weapon to make an attack roll. Proficiency and attribute modifiers are automatically 
    added to the roll based on your characters class and proficiencies as well as the weapon you specify.
    Attack and damage rolls are made at the same time. If you need to attack with advantage, add the + character
    to the end of the roll. If you need to attack with disadvantage, add the - character to the end of the roll.
    If the situation calls for a more complex roll that isn't automatically handled by this command, use the
    roll command instead.

    Examples
    attack greatsword   Make an attack roll using a greatsword
    attack dagger +     Make an attack roll with a dagger at advantage
    attack dagger -     Make an attack roll with a dagger at disadvantage
