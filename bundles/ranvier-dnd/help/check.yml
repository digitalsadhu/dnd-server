command: attack
body: |
    Perform a skill or attribute check roll. The appropriate modifiers will be added to the roll 
    automatically. Eg. If your character is proficient at insight and has an intelligence score of 17
    then +5 will automatically be added to the roll.
    If the DM asks for something like a perception check you should use this command.
    You can use the + and - symbols to make the roll at advantage or disadvantage respectively

    Examples
    check perception      Make a perception check
    check perception +    Make a perception check at advantage
    check str             Make a strength check
    check strength        Make a strength check
